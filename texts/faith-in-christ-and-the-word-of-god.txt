Faith in Christ and the Word of God


Dear Brothers and Sisters…
This looks like the closest I will ever get in my life to having a farewell talk—because funny story… I’m not going anywhere! Much of my mission happens at a computer logging in remotely to the Chruch’s Business HQ and doing IT work and lots of customer service. The other half of my mission happens at our local Library. I won’t experience the MTC. I don’t have mission-lingo like STL or ZL. It’s literally just me doing something that our Lord Jesus Christ wants me to do.
Today. Jesus wants me to use my God-given talent of public speaking to invite the Holy Spirit to teach us all about Faith and how Faith connects to the Word of God, and how that Word connects us to Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father.

“I sense a lot of talks from me in the near future”

The early chapter of John speaks about Jesus Christ being the Word. The original Greek of the New Testament, (before it was translated into English), reveals some interesting trivia that sheds some light on the bible itself. So, the word “Word” is often affiliated with the term in those ancient times that meant “News.” Also in ancient Hebrew, the terms Testament also meant testimony and sometimes “News.”
This Verse I would like to open with, although you have probably already guessed it,
Is the first few verses of the Gospel of John.
Here we have a mini retelling of the creation story given in Genesis. Emphasisng Jesus Christ’s role in it all. That’s right, this is the big reveal. Jesus Christ is the Word. Or it’s more accurate to say if you look at the original language before the bible was compiled and translated. Jesus Christ is the Good News. He was with Heavenly Father in the beginning and was and is His Son. Heavenly Father’s only begotten. These verses go really deep into Christ’s role in God’s Plan of happiness and I would need a lot more than just 12 minutes to unpack them for you, but suffice to say that Jesus Christ is the Word. However, haven’t we also often heard another phrase?
“The Word of God being Scripture?”
Everything proceeding out of Jesus Christ’s mouth when he is teaching is Scripture. Every inspired word that comes out of the mouth of a prophet is considered Scripture. Many Prophets of old have had their words written down and compiled into the familiar good books that we know and love as the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon. So, is Jesus Christ the word? Or is what the prophets say?
The technical answer is both!
Jesus Christ is the good news that was brought to our first Parents Adam and Eve, and they were promised that one of their seed would eventually destroy their enemy, Satan who had tempted them to Fall in the first place. However, as Jesus Christ was currently Jehovah and not born yet, God needed a way to carry the good news of his coming to the world…before he was born. As well as after. This is why we have Scriptures and the Prophets. The “Inspired” word is God’s word spoken by the Prophets and through revelation.
I am serving you and the Lord when I give this talk, for I am to speak to you about Faith in Christ and how it connects to the important and sacred scriptures, the Word of God. Also, how studying the Word of God can give us faith building experiences. However, do not mistake me, I do not mean a circle or a cycle of learning. Because as we know, if you simply run around in a circle, you will only cross ground that you’ve already been one. That’s fine. But I’m here to speak on finding new experiences of Faith. Unlike most books in the world today, the books that make up the Standard Works, or in more accurate terms: The Word of God, will always give you new lessons. Like a spiral our testimonies as s we use what we have learned already will grow. Our most important testimony is of God. 
1.	Do we truly Love God First?
2.	Do we know him and trust him?
3.	Do we love others as he does?
These three questions help me figure out whether or not I have or am exercising faith in Jesus Christ.

In 2nd Nephi, chapter 25 verses 25 and 26 say:
“25 For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.
26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.”
~2 Nephi 25:25-26 
But what is faith? Well brothers and sisters, let me tell you. Turns out there are a lot of scriptures in Mathew. (One of the four accounts of the Gospel of Christ, commonly referred to as the gospels.) Let’s start with a story that has recently touched my heart from Matthew chapter 8:
“What is faith?”
Matt 8:10
This chapter talks about a gentile centurion who comes to Jesus Christ after hearing and perhaps seeing some of the Savior’s miracles while serving under the Roman Military. He believes that what Jesus Christ says and does simply becomes reality. There very well might be an explanation as to why what Jesus Christ does and says happens. However, regardless of an explanation—for Faith doesn’t need one. The Centurion trusts his God that his poor servant will be healed. A Gentile in that day. Might become a member of the Church in the next. Faith doesn’t need to look like knowing it will happen. It can be a mustard seed, or you may have some doubt to overcome, however this Roman man who once prayed to many gods such as the Jupiter and June of the Olympian Pagan religion, now comes to the REAL God. Jesus Christ. He forsakes his doubt, his old religion, and comes unto Christ. 
Give God a chance and he will prove your faith. That faith being the intention and trust you place in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Living by faith is to continue to do this, and as it happens when you have faith in Christ that has been proved that experience becomes a sort of evidence on which to base more faith on. Like a ball of knitting yarn, as the string is laid down on the wrapped ball, the ball grows. As we seek out and intentionally place our trust and hope in the Lord Jesus Christ, our Faith will grow like that ball of yarn. Unlike your typical scholar who searches for evidence before he chooses to believe, we choose to let ourselves believe a little bit, like a small teaspoon, and then that faith is tested, and as we have experiences where we grow our faith, those memories harden into a foundation of evidence on which to do this whole experience again. We keep looking for faith-building experiences and by doing so—build memories and experiences of faith in Jesus Christ. 
Isn’t it interesting that as we act in faith and then we prove that faith into evidence, rather than wait around for evidence to fall into our lap? Faith doesn’t need to be pre-reviewed to act upon it. Living by faith, not waiting on faith, is what is asked of us.
“How do we live by it?”
Mathew 9 has three stories of faith. Some of you may have heard these stories before.
First there is the Woman who was a paralytic. Who had tried to be healed in many ways and from many people, yet no doctor of the time nor priest of any religion could help her. When Jesus passes by in Mathew 9:20-22, all she thinks of is the power and the stories she has heard about Jesus Christ. She thinks of God, and the evidence she has heard. For us those stories are the Holy Scriptures. Then the Woman acts because as we know already, Faith is an Action Word. You have to act on it to prove it. Listen to the Holy Ghost and act. Verse 21 of this chapter is just this poor paralytic woman thinking that if she could just touch his garment, I will be made whole. Not might! But WILL be made whole. Doubt is the enemy of Faith.
Second there is the story of a certain ruler, who’s name isn’t given in Mathew 9, but this ruler who has a daughter comes to Christ and says to him:
“My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.”
Does he know that Jesus is the prophesied Messiah the Prophets from the Old Testament spoke of? Maybe. Either way, he does know of Jesus of Nazareth. He has heard of—might have even seen Jesus Christ heal somebody else at another time. That is what a small “mustard seed” of faith is. These stories seem to have a pattern in common.
1.	We hear of Jesus Christ from a source we trust. (Like Missionaries for example)
2.	We choose to believe after a little bit of pondering on what we’ve heard.
3.	We ACT in that trust that we have built and hope for an answer. Or in other words, We ACT in faith.
4.	If we have placed our Faith in Jesus Christ, then it will be rewarded with an experience that teaches us more about Jesus Christ and prepares us to have more faith.
The last step in this pattern is something that I exhort you all to do.
5.	Rinse and Repeat. You have evidence now. No more excuses, go and seek out faith building experiences even if you have to feel like you are walking blindly in the dark, for The Lord Jesus Christ will light your way, that ye may see and listen to the Holy Ghost as He teaches you what God would have you do, learn, and live by.

“How can we make sure that it’s faith in Jesus Christ?”

Interesting notes from research:

“The Teachings of Jesus Christ” given by Elder Dallin H. Oaks.
We can make sure that our Faith is in Jesus Christ because we have records of his life and ministry. Faith building experiences don’t always need some tragedy as a precursor.  *Lifts up scriptures* we can have faith building experiences as much and anywhere we want. So, why don’t we? This is a serious thing that we need to sit down and ask ourselves, why do I struggle with reading the words of Christ more often? Thankfully those answers to your problems are also given through these teachings of Jesus Christ. We can keep our faith centered on Jesus Christ if we simply learn how to apply his teachings to our lives. Whatever distractions from Jesus Christ’s doctrine, will become less appealing as we become more like the savior filled with his pure love for all of God’s children. I invite you to search the words of Christ from the 4 first gospels in the New Testament, and to study what Jesus Christ says to the prophets of the Old Testament and of the Book of Mormon, like studying 3rd Nephi, the crowning moment of the Book of Mormon when Jesus Christ comes to visit the people of the Americas and finally ministers to them in person. Studying Jesus Christ’s scriptures and his prophet’s words, for whether they be His words, or His servants, it is the same Word. And The Word is Jesus Christ. Act on those principles taught in the scriptures and apply those faith building steps to make memories and strengthen testimonies of your Savior Jesus Christ and His Scriptures.


Deut 32:20
“Fro-word” similar to forward, seems to mean people who think they are forward (progressing) but are actually perverse!
Habakkuk 2:4
MY interpretation is that those who are prideful are not standing erect before God, but rather are lifted up in their minds, but not upright in Jesus Christ. However, the just-good-people live by Faith in Jesus Christ.
That reminds me of not leaning unto our own understanding, but God’s.
