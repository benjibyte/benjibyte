<span id="date">3rd Report 9/15/2024</span><br><br>Here I am sitting on the couch listening to my brother-in-law's plans for school. It makes me --uh-oh, I was about to say the "proud" word that is connected to pride. Grateful + pleased would be a better description of the word that we mean and try to say.<br><br><br><br>I was just reading the Books of Moses, specifically the one in the Pearl of Great Price that is the... unmodified version of Genesis. It has a lot more details in how the Fall actually happened and exactly *why* Lucifer became Satan. Very enlightening stuff that strengthens what was already in the Holy Bible as the books of Moses. I'm grateful I have these other Scriptures, additional testimonies of God, yea, even Jesus Christ. It makes the Old Testament make a lot more sense.<br><br> My family meets every Sunday online through a Facebook Messenger video call. Around 5pm we share the Scriptures and insights we receive by feasting upon the Word of God. I just finished my little bit. I shared how I struggled to finish the Book of Mormon because of the distracting temptations to think of other things! (Yea, even wicked temptations.) So great was the harrowing up in my mind, but I was blessed by the Holy Spirit to remember something my father once told me:<br><br>"If Satan is tempting you, that must mean that there is something God wants for you right around the corner...That Satan doesn't want you to have!"<br><br>So determined, I kept reading the Book of Mormon and I finished it that study session. I think that was an act of faith, although I didn't realize it at the time. So a few days before I finished the Book of Mormon again, my dad asked if I could give a talk.<br><br><br><br>This talk was about the Word of God and having faith in Jesus Christ. Dad just wanted me to talk about faith, though little did he know--that service missionaries are told by our service mission leaders to write lots of talks to have on standby just in case we are called. So, it was quite the surprise for my dad when he found out I already had a talk ready! (Except the end, I forgot that I hadn't included closing remarks until the morning of giving the talk!) So there I was giving a talk that was written around 3 weeks prior, maybe more. On the ride to our local Ward, my Mother reminded me that sometimes we underestimate how long we give our talks, (especially my family) and it took me ten minutes to just get 2 thirds of the way through the talk!<br><br>Thankfully, we got to Church in time. (I was a slow turtle trying to be a perfectionist getting the perfect ending, which made us late, but that's unuasal because I'm often the first person ready for Church.) It all turned out well in the end, and don't worry if you missed my talk because I will leave a link to it on this website. However, Toward the end...<br><br>...I was bearing my testimony of God and his scriptures, I used one title of Jesus Christ after the other, ending simply with "THE LORD JESUS CHRIST." <br><br> BOOM! All of a sudden I invited to Holy Spirit like a crash--It felt so sudden and strong! I've felt the Holy Ghost super strong before, like when I was going to the Temple with my Maternal Grandparents and older Brother Joseph to get my endowments, but this time it was so strong it felt as if Jesus Christ was standing by me. It felt POWERFUL.<br><br>It was the closest to a farewell talk that I will ever get to give because I am a service Missionary. However it was for the best, and how do I know this? Well here is the epitome of this story.<br><br><br><br>After my talk was over, I was sitting watching the other guy (a nice guy from the Stake High Council) speak after me at the pulpit. I thought of that moment when I felt the Holy Spirit fill my whole being. (Or perhaps this happened while I was giving the Talk) but I heard a distinct voice that wasn't quite sounding like how the Holy Ghost usually talks to me. The voice said to me in a resounding and bold Voice:<br><br>"YOU ARE *MY* REPRESENTATIVE"<br><br>If you know anything about misisonaries, then you know that we are called to be a certain special person's representative. Yea, even our Lord Jesus Christ. So in that somber yet POWERFUL moment, I knew and testify that God spoke to me through the power of the Holgy Ghost. Jesus claimed me with such assurance that I cannot and never will doub it. I am his representative, and his Service Missionary.<br><br><br><br>I think I got the testimony I asked for when I finished the Book of Mormon, and the testimony of being a Missionary for Jesus Christ.<br><br>~ Elder Brinkerhoff
