My Mother just told me that when I write my Reports... is when the missionary in me takes precedence over the programmer in me. So here I am writing a 2nd Report! <br><br><br><br>Unlike teaching-missionaries who have something called a P-Day, where they have to do their laundry and any slightly fun activities such as writing their weekly emails or attending an activity for their area put together by their STL (Sister Training Leader) or their ZL (Zone Leader), which means other missionaries of differing rank for those who aren‚Äôt familiar with the Mission-Lingo. <br><br><br><br>  I however, have no such thing! (So that‚Äôs all the mission-lingo you‚Äôll get from me, because no such thing exists for me, Thus I will simply not experience stuff like that.) I on the other hand have this wonderful little blog of a website that I get to maintain and code from scratch, so that you guys can read it any time you want!<br><br><br><br><br><br> It also means that I can update it as much as I want, whenever I want.  So, this article might come as a surprise to some of you who expect their missionaries to only have weekly emails.<br><br><br><br><br><br>You know, a prompting from the Holy Spirit just came to me! I should send this website to an old Dance Teacher of mine. I think she would appreciate it very much! This Report will contain some memories from a general missionary conference and a couple experiences that I have had as a GSD missionary. (If you don‚Äôt remember what GSD means, see Report #1.) <br><br><br><br><br><br>Now, I say ‚Äúmissionary‚Äù conference because it is different than your typical General Conference that only happens twice a year. These conferences are hosted in a mission-field. My Mission field is the ‚ÄúBentonville Arkansas Mission,‚Äù and each mission has a missionary president which in my case is an older man named President Hathaway.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So, these conferences are hosted by him and everyone in this mission is invited (including Service Missionaries!) to come hear their missionary president speak to them. However, he isn‚Äôt the only speaker! <br><br><br><br><br><br>There is often a General Authority of the Church at these ‚ÄúMissionary Conferences‚Äù like an apostle if you are lucky, but more often a member of the Seventy! There were two Elders of the Seventy here. Elder Christensen and a brand new Elder that I know none of you have heard of before (except maybe once when he was called) Elder Buccaneer! Elder Buccaneer is so freshly ordained an elder of the Seventy that he hasn‚Äôt given any General Conference Talks! (And I mean normal conference talks, the ones that happen in April and October.) <br><br><br><br><br><br>So, it felt like I was blessed to get a sneak peek at what he might be like in Conference, and boy am I excited! Let me tell you why‚Ä¶    So, there I was, sitting shoulder to shoulder with other Elders and Sisters in my Arkansas Bentonville Mission. (Still feels weird calling it *my* mission since I grew up here.) <br><br><br><br><br><br>Most of them were Teaching Missionaries of course, and they probably assumed that I was a teaching missionary like them. Most of the Sister Missionaries sat up front of the Springfield Ward Chapel, in Springfield Missouri. But us Elder Missionaries filled the rest of the room üòé.<br><br><br><br><br><br> It felt very unifying, and a little nice back then‚Äîto feel that none of the other Elders in that room thought I was a Teaching Missionary like them. Now of course, I am well pleased with myself that I am a Service Missionary, and I don‚Äôt forget to let people know that I am!  (I try not to say the word ‚Äúproud,‚Äù because it infers that I was prideful, and we should honestly sever those two words from each other in the English language because they do NOT mean the same thing. Saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you son‚Äù means the same thing that Heavenly Father said: ‚ÄúBehold my beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased!‚Äù See? God doesn‚Äôt once say anything connected to the word ‚Äúpride,‚Äù because pride is a sin, and we should say well-pleased instead, I think. Anyways that‚Äôs just a silly little opinion of mine.)<br><br><br><br><br><br>Where was I? Oh yes, there we were sitting in the pews waiting to be edified by the Holy Spirit. Elder Christensen is soon introduced to us by President Hathaway as the all-day long conference begins. He is an older man with gray hair, and as he walked up to the pulpit, I was able to recognize him as a General Authority. Most Elders of the Seventy (except Elder Buccaneer who is brand new) have given general conference talks before, and I was expecting this to be much like a typical talk given at general conference.<br><br><br><br>Nope! ‚ÄúNever mind, I don‚Äôt want to talk up here, let‚Äôs go down to the missionaries.‚Äù says Elder Christensen, just before he got to the pulpit. So, here come lots of old senior couples down from the stairs (I don‚Äôt think they liked having to move from their comfy chairs just as they got comfortable,) to stand on the same floor that we are on right next to the pews just as if they are the local Sunday School teacher with a wipe-off whiteboard!<br><br><br><br><br><br>It wasn‚Äôt conventional at all. But it gets even better‚Ä¶Elder Christensen starts walking alongside the front of the first row of the pews and goes about very slowly.<br><br><br><br>So, in a way it‚Äôs still as reserved and reverent as if he had taught us up from the pulpit, except that he wanted to know us a little more. <br><br><br><br>After all he IS a general authority who flew in from Salt Lake City, Utah, to come survey our mission. So, this is how he began, giving a deep doctrinal talk about doing the Lord Jesus Christ‚Äôs work and how hard that is. <br><br><br><br><br><br>He even touched on the nature of how much pressure there is when you are divinely ordained to be an Apostle or Elder: ‚ÄúEvery time you get in front of a crowd‚Äù he says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you feel all this pressure because everyone expects that everything you say is sacred and inspired.‚Äù He goes on to talk about stuff like the ‚Äúinspired word‚Äù and how revelation works, and how as missionaries we need to consider the amazing guidance, we can give others when we listen to what God tells us to do through the Holy ghost.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I felt very edified, and I was busy taking notes, so I only looked up every once in a while. (In total I have 25 pages worth of notes from that conference!) and then the young man sitting next to me who is also an Elder Missionary like me, who was having a hard time keeping up in his notes, asked me which scriptures that the speaker, Elder Christensen of the Seventy, had mentioned. I leaned to the right and tried to whisper to him without stopping to write my notes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I knew the scriptures, and I presumed that this young Elder had a hard time reading social ques, and also had a hard time keeping up. So, I felt God asking me to help him out while Elder Christensen kept talking. Then the speaker changed to Elder Buccaneer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Then all of a sudden, a different Elder Missionary that was sitting in front of us turns his heads around and practically hisses a ‚Äúshhhhhh‚Äù at us.<br><br>It was very rude of him. I know we weren‚Äôt being as quiet as we could. However, this is an example of teaching missionaries not considering that sometimes Service missionaries had disabilities, and sometimes normal people just can‚Äôt tell that they were being loud. (Like the Elder I was helping.) <br><br><br><br>So, at first, I felt a hot surge of anger at this Elder even though I knew he didn‚Äôt know any better. Then almost immediately the Speaker, Elder Buccaneer started going DEEP into why it‚Äôs important to love our neighbor because God loves us! Instant guilt.<br><br><br><br>Ouch.<br><br><br><br>But guess what?! Almost instantly the anger was washed away as I listened to the inspired words of the Lord‚Äôs appointed Elder Buccaneer! The commandment that we must Love God first, and our neighbor second in all of our doings actually helps us love more! If I had only ‚ÄúLoved my neighbor,‚Äù then I would only be able to forgive that rude Elder in front of us after I cooled down.<br><br><br><br>When we are in correspondence with God and show him that we love Jesus Christ more than our own petty feelings than we can love and forgive our neighbor even when it usually would take longer!<br><br><br><br>If I didn‚Äôt love God First before the second great commandment to love my neighbor, then I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to forgive that Elder who didn‚Äôt know any better.<br><br><br><br>So, in short, it is important that the first Great Commandment, To Love God, *must* come first in all of our relationships! Our husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, siblings, friends. EVERYONE. We have to Love God more than Them so that we can love them more with God‚Äôs help.<br><br><br><br>In fact, I would go so far as to say that ugly divorce wouldn‚Äôt happen in a marriage if the two married individuals included Jesus Christ in their relationship more! I know it can be weird to think that you have to Love God more than someone else to love that someone else even more. That wording can be confusing if you don‚Äôt think through it, (or live through it like I just had) but it‚Äôs absolutely, undeniably true!<br><br><br><br><br><br>In Simpler wording...<br><br><br><br>Loving God helps us love others more than we would be capable on our own. We can‚Äôt earn forgiveness; we can only receive it. Then how do we give it?<br><br><br><br>Fun Insight: It isn‚Äôt from us.<br><br> <br><br>Not actually us anyway, what really happens on the spiritual level is that it‚Äôs God‚Äôs love through us that forgives people. Our part in the matter is choosing to forgive, or in other words: Try to see them as God does.<br><br>Then when we actually get to know the other person, we have a relationship with them. This is why it‚Äôs so hard to forgive people you know rather than strangers‚Äîit‚Äôs because when you have a relationship that is rough with someone: God‚Äôs love for that person clashes with your hurt from that person and it becomes harder to forgive.<br><br><br><br>HOWEVER, when we love God first, we can borrow his love for a bit and see others as he sees them.<br><br><br><br>The way Elder Buccaneer (or was its Elder Christensen?) put it was that you have to realize that the version of a person that you know is who they are now in the current moment. BUT‚Äîif you think about that person from the eternal perspective, how God sees them then it is easier to forgive them.<br><br>Then once you leave that perspective and you go back to just being yourself, it‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs hard to remember that you hated that person. Or at least it is that way for me when I TRULY forgive somebody on a deep level.<br><br><br><br><br><br>So that‚Äôs why I phrased that line the way I did. Because when we forgive somebody, Jesus Christ doesn‚Äôt just wash away their sins when they are sorry‚Äîbut when we forgive? Our anger is washed away too. Though sometimes it takes a while. (That‚Äôs because our hurt is clashing with God‚Äôs love for them in our hearts, when we try to forgive them.)<br><br><br><br>In short, Celestial Love is far greater than anything our chemical human emotions are capable of, and when you are truly joyful‚Äîyou are experiencing God‚Äôs love for you!<br><br><br><br><br><br>So, it was a very deep and enlightening talk about WHY the first commandment comes before the second great commandment. (By the great commandments, I‚Äôm talking about THE Ten Commandments, by the way.)<br><br><br><br><br><br>Now wasn‚Äôt that just amazing? Imagine being there hearing all of this. I had pieced it together myself and once had a Sunday school lesson in the past about all this, but to hear it from a general authority‚Äôs own words was AWESOME. <br><br><br><br>Oh wait, you don‚Äôt have to imagine it because in this report there are photos! Well, a painting, not really a photograph, but here it is anyway:  <br><br><br><br><br><br><picture>                    <source srcset="images/missionary-conference-painting-small.webp" media="(max-width: 750px)">                    <source srcset="images/missionary-conference-painting-large.webp">                    <img src="images/missionary-conference-painting-large.webp"                        alt="a small painting of Elder Buccanear passionately sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ.">                </picture><br><br><br><br>Here we see Elder Buccaneer, who was SO active! His black Sunday-coat was flapping this way and that, and while Elder Christensen calmly walked around, Elder Buccaneer was very loud and energetic!<br><br><br><br>I tried to capture him in the painting in these really dynamic poses being so *passionate* about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and why it is so important to spread it.<br><br>It was very obvious that he was a freshly ordained Elder of the Seventy, and it certainly wasn‚Äôt the quiet and ‚Äúreverent‚Äù talk that Elder Christensen gave that one would expect of an ordained Elder of the Seventy (at least not the typical kind of reverence that we in America are taught).<br><br><br><br>Rather it was very vigorous and active; he would run over here and draw something on the wipe-off board, the next minute he would be on the other side of the congregation waving his arms. (If you couldn‚Äôt tell, he talks with his hands a lot.) <br><br><br><br>This man IS a general authority, and we will all probably see him at this upcoming October Conference! Yet here he was, running around like a Deacon on Sunday! This was the very same talk about loving God first. He was very passionate about this, and I felt the Holy Spirit very strongly (I learned that day that sometimes reverence isn‚Äôt just being silent while the grown-ups are talking, sometimes it‚Äôs running around praising the Lord).<br><br><br><br><br><br>In the bottom right of that painting I did, we have Elder Christensen just calmly watching this young (in comparison to him) new general Seventy running around and flapping his arms up and down trying to get his message of Loving God first across to us even younger missionaries!<br><br><br><br>When this (Love God > Love Neighbor) talk was all over, Elder Christensen got back up from his seat and conducted the rest of the conference (we had lunch and a Q&A after).<br><br><br><br><br><br>However, Elder Christensen made sure to comment on the younger Seventy‚Äôs performance:<br><br>‚ÄúAs you know, he has recently been ordained and hasn‚Äôt spoken at Conference yet.‚Äù<br><br>(and this was in front of everyone here) <br><br><br><br> He continued: ‚ÄúI can barely imagine Elder Buccaneer trying to give his address to the whole congregation of the world at General Conference.‚Äù<br><br><br><br>Elder Christensen then grabbed an imaginary pulpit like he‚Äôs trying to strangle it and shakes his arms and says:<br><br><br><br>‚ÄúIt will probably be something like this, barely able to keep himself contained.‚Äù <br><br><br><br>Everybody laughed as the joke was in very good humor.<br><br>So, it was a wonderful conference! (Don‚Äôt worry, I made sure to be an active participant in the Q&A)  Now, I have kept you all waiting long for some stories that happened in the Global Service Department of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day saints‚Ä¶<br><br><br><br>There I was, a young Service Missionary on my first day of service for the GSD. Little did I know that I was about to enter a strange and very businesslike world of the organization side of the Church.<br><br><br><br>I was sitting there in my Sunday Best at my desk with my laptop open and connected to its second monitor with my Logitech Headset connected and ready for a Microsoft Teams meeting. An old friend of mine gave me this headset, the very same young man that once played tennis in Willow springs mentioned in the last report.<br><br><br><br>Soon enough, it came in an email to my missionary google email account previously given to me by the Church Missionary Department.<br><br><br><br>I clicked on the meeting link, made sure I looked presentable, and there I was in a devotional.<br><br><br><br>In just one second, I was transported from the Bentonville Arkansas Service Mission to the Global Service Department, where I thought the vast majority of service missionaries served. <br><br>Some served on campus in Utah in their own offices just like a business, others were like me‚Äîremote, but fully setup as if I worked there for a day-job.<br><br><br><br><br><br>There was *hundreds* of missionaries there. It truly was a global experience, and we were all singing together (but behind muted mics for some reason that I don‚Äôt know yet, but I already think it‚Äôs very dumb,) and there was a great devotional and spiritual thoughts, and announcements that I‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôm allowed to disclose to the general public of the Church!<br><br><br><br>So, right away I felt like I was a part of the Global Service Department. Or the GSD for short. <br><br><br><br>This didn‚Äôt last however, being on the same online meeting as officials of the church was amazing, but as soon as it was over I was so confused! <br><br><br><br><br><br>I don‚Äôt think I can explain or put it into words! I‚Äôll try my best though‚Ä¶For those of you who have been missionaries, imagine that it‚Äôs your first area, and you are a brand-new fresh missionary‚Äîand all of a sudden everything you learned in the MTC‚Ä¶  <br><br><br><br>Oh, yeah. I don‚Äôt even have an MTC! I don‚Äôt have a Companion to show me the ropes either!<br><br>Service missionaries unlike Teaching missionaries are thrown into a much more ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù end of the pool, as we have no MTC training or companion-Trainer to follow around.<br><br><br><br>So at least you can now imagine the confusion I felt, and I suddenly felt very meek. If I was on a street and knocking doors like a teaching missionary, at least I would be in my comfort zone talking to people! (Though I assure you, I am still very much an introvert)<br><br><br><br><br><br>Soon the Holy Ghost, my TRUE companion on my mission, was able to remind me that I was in an organization now, and even though it felt like an entirely different mission than serving at the local library, I was still a Service Missionary, and people would therefore understand if I asked Questions.<br><br><br><br>Now the app that the GSD uses for meetings is called Microsoft Teams (it is a lot like Zoom), and this app shows who you are supposed to report to if you know where to click and look for their name.<br><br>Which was a hassle by the way, but I eventually found the person I was supposed to talk to. <br><br><br><br><br><br>So, I moved my little computer mouse and sent her a message through the Teams App. She soon responded and replied that she was in a meeting where she was discussing where to put me! <br><br>I sat tight at my computer and decided to do something service oriented while I waited.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Service missionaries ‚Äúare on the clock,‚Äù and clock in their service hours. It‚Äôs a lot less cut and dry like Teaching Missionary schedules who all have the same schedule that they are given. <br><br>So, since I was clocked in for 7 service hours‚Äîbecause for many at the GSD, it is a literal office job‚ÄîI did some indexing while I waited for my new supervisor to get back to me. <br><br><br><br>Indexing was already familiar to me because I was friends with the old Family History Consultant in my Ward, and more importantly my grandparents were indexers and my Nanna on my mother‚Äôs side used to hold an important and very high-up rank in the family search organization. (Or at least I think she did, my Nanna can correct me when she reads this‚Ä¶ Hi Nanna!)<br><br><br><br>But this comfort wasn‚Äôt too last‚Ä¶ <br><br><br><br>I got a reply to my message after that new supervisor got out of her meeting. I don‚Äôt really remember her name, which is okay I guess, since she is no longer my supervisor since she told me that I was to be transferred to a different team!<br><br><br><br><br><br>Alright. Before I let the cat out of the bag, I have to remind you of something. Do you know the Member Tools app? You might have once called it the LDS Tools app? (Because that was its old name.) It‚Äôs a useful tool that lets you know some basic contact information and addresses of your local ward. If it occasionally breaks, then you send an email or something like that to Customer Service, right?<br><br><br><br>Well, uhm‚Ä¶ funny thing is‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs me now! Yep! I was called on this mission by the Lord Jesus Christ, and I‚Äôm using my God-Given Talents to reply to a bunch of emails (and THERE IS A LOT of emails) and give some minor Information Technology specialist help through the emails I write.<br><br>This is really cool because it makes me feel like my Dad. On the other hand, it feels like a full-time job, but it gets really tedious.<br><br><br><br><br><br>When I first received news that I was to join the ‚ÄúMember Tools App Response team,‚Äù I was a little excited! But getting started was really hard, as the elder missionary that was put in charge of my training went by his slide show really fast and he kind of acted a little stand-offish. <br><br><br><br><br><br>So, I kind of had to learn on the go! There was new software, websites, and secret information (like member record numbers for instance) that I had to handle and protect.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I deal with a lot of classified intel about real people in the church too (membership record numbers, their real names and such). So, I can‚Äôt tell you too much about each individual case‚Äîbut suffice it to say that I felt like I was drowning in work.<br><br><br><br>Pretty soon I thought I would be all gun-hoe about doing the Lord‚Äôs work like I usually was!  <br><br><br><br>‚Ä¶No.<br><br><br><br>I was still confused in the beginning, but then I had a wonderful Elder named Elder Ketchum. He is the closest thing I‚Äôve had to what I‚Äôve heard having a ‚ÄúTrainer Companion‚Äù is like. He WAS AWESOME!<br><br><br><br>He was the one who helped show me the ropes, and I really did feel loved and accounted for in this very business side of the church that most people never get to see.<br><br><br><br>I felt Jesus Christ‚Äôs love for me through Elder Ketchum, who is also a Service missionary like me! After a few days of working at the GSD remotely from my little computer on my desk, I feel like a very accomplished part of a team, like the backstage crew in a theater play or musical.<br><br><br><br>Now, I have to go now. Speaking of teams, I have a meeting right now!<br><br><br><br>God be with you till I update this website again (tomorrow likely)<br><br><br><br><br><br>   ~ Elder Brinkerhoff
