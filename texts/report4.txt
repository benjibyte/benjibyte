Alright, here is my 4th report. I was at the library today and while not too much happened, (Just serving one of my favorite local organizations, the Library, so I was shelving stuff like DVDs and Audiobooks,) however a lot of internal things happened!

If you've spent almost a whole morning looking at DVD Cases, which is not something that most missionaries do...Then it can be a little down-putting seeing Hollywood movie after movie throwing famous faces in front of you trying to sell you two hours of a what's likely a waste of time! Not to mention the worldly world is full of people that want to be worshipped!

Then I shook my head and then God reminded me that I was here to serve the Library, not get down in the dumps because I disagree with what most people checkout of the library! So I tried to focus on my service for service sake, not what I was actually doing--And Guess what! I was able to actually do what I was supposed to be doing a lot faster.

Why do I share this experience? Well, simply because it provided me with an other reason to Love God and why it's the first great commandment  given to every Prophet at the beginning of every dispensation! If you don't have anything that you care more about than yourself, then you will only care about yourself. Feel free to quote me on that! (As long as you use "Elder Brinkerhoff") 

Another quote you should always remember is what our Prophet, President Russel M. Nelson has told us!

"...Now is the time for you to meet God...Decide what kind of life you want to live..."

There are some things that he said would help us remember our Eternal goals and stay on track for the long-haul. In case you don't remember them here they are!

<ol>
<li>"Know the truth about who you are"</li>
<li>"Know the Truth about what Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ have offered you"</li>
<li>"Know the truth related to your conversion."</li>
</ol>

When we remember that we are Children of God and Disciples of Jesus Christ, then that becomes our first foundation to our identity. Objective Morality exists and it is harder to do bad stuff when we are focused on doing some of that good stuff. 

So I came up with this quote that I already said, about why it's important to have someone like "God" that you value more important than your own self otherwise selfishness will come. Selfishness is bad, right? Yes! It is, because it throws any moral code out the window and destroys your relationships with other people. Most importantly, Jesus Christ was selfless, and if you want to follow him and be like him then selflessness should be a goal of yours. It is mine! (Albeit I will admit, it is very hard sometimes...)

I know this report is rather short, but I have a lot more pictures this time and was thinking that if I had shorter but more frequent reports then my audience would be a little happier. See! There is a little bit of Selflessness already! Now, go pray and ask for Help from Heavenly Father that you can make somebody's day a little more happy.
